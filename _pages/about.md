Hi, I’m Zeyi Ren, a M.Phil. student at the department of EEE, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by [Prof. Yik-Chung Wu](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~ycwu/). Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). I have also worked as a visiting research intern at [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](https://www.sribd.cn/), collaborated with [Dr. Yang Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yang-Li-196) (Transferring to Great Bay University in March 2025).

My research interests mainly focus on **Interpretable-AI for Wireless Communications** and **Statistical Machine Learning**.<br>
During my undergraduate studies, I concentrated on Localization problems in wireless networks, with a particular emphasis on the Cooperative Localization.<br>

I'm also a Bilibili influencer with 160k followers, where you can check my videos by searching the ID [*向前的赵*](https://space.bilibili.com/471218890?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)
